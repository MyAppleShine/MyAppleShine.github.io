Bharatanatyam is a classical Indian dance form from Tamil Nadu, southern India, renowned for its intricate rhythms, expressive hand gestures, and stylized facial expressions. Derived from the Sanskrit words for "essence" (Bha), "melody" (Ra), and "rhythm" (Ta), it features pure abstract dance and interpretative storytelling (Nrityam).
